# obsidian-css-snippets

Most common appearance solutions for Obsidian now in a single place. Initially collected by Klaas: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-achieve-css-code-snippets/8474

As a CSS newbie I have to frequently ask fellow Obsidianites what code to use to achieve a certain effect in my custom CSS sheet.
I have made a habit of collecting these habits, and, to make them more easily searchable.
I thought it might be useful to share this with others, who can then add their own snippets.
I have categorized the snippets on the basis of what they are used for, and have added # headers.

Note: the snippets are supplied as they are, and as I am not a CSS expert I cannot assist in fixing errors that might occur if e.g. there are clashes with other parts of your CSS.

**If there’s an interesting piece of code you think is missing you made add it with a pull request in the Github repository (provided you have a Github account), or post it here and I’ll add it.**
